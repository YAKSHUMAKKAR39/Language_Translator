# Language_Translator
<p>Language Translator using Google APIs, interface using Tkinter</p>

<p>Google APIs are a lot fun. We can complete our huge, tedious task done in just a few lines of code. I have used some Google API and python libraries to build a language translator - speech recognition, googletrans, translate, gtts(Google-Text-to-Speech).</p>

<p>The user can record his message (which is to be translated) or simply type in the text box given. After selecting the language in which the user wants to convert the message, the button to convert should be clicked. The translated message is printed in the output text box. The user can even listen to this translated message.</p>

<p>After desisgning a proper layout for it's interface, I have made seperate functions - to translate the text, to record the input, to feed the output to the output box, and to hear the translated message.</p>
